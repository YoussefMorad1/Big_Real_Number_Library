# Big_Real
 
Big_Real is a C++ class that can hold a real number with unlimited number of digits (no minimum or maximum boundries) and supports math functions between Big_Reals.

This library needs another library to use composition of another class called "Big_Decimal_Int" which can hold an integer number with unlimited digits, [we created this library before](https://github.com/osama392maher/Big_Int_Assignment)..
But to practice working with other programmers' code we used a "Big_Decimal_Int" library that was written by another team
