# Big_Real
 
In this library we developed a C++ class that can hold a real number with unlimited number of digits with (no minimum or maximum boundries) and the supporting math functions

This library uses another library called "Big_Decimal_Int" which can hold an integer number with unlimited digits we created this library before..
but to practice working with other programmers' code we used a "Big_Decimal_Int" library that was written by another team
